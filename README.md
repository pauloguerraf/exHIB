exHIB
=====

exHIB is a [Processing](https://www.processing.org) library built as part of my work for UIC's Innovation Lab and its project [History Moves](https://historymoves.org). 

The objective of exHIB was to group all the tools we developed during the interface design and test process for the project. The library was used to mount the first prototype of a mobile museum exhibit intended to move around the city of Chicago inside a bus.

The library provides inputs to manage traditional museum interfaces such as image/video galleries and timelines, thorugh not traditional inputs provided by sensors such as the Kinect, or potentiometers and conductive ink connected to an Arduino.
